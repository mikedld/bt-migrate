About
==========

Inspired by [old 'wontfix' Transmission ticket](https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2642) and couple of mentions on [Transmission IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/transmission), here is a tool to ease migration from one BitTorrent client to another.

Prerequisites
=============

- You will need [boost](http://www.boost.org/) library installed.
- sqlite3
- cmake
- g++

For e.g. on Ubuntu:
```
$ sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev libboost-all-dev build-essential
```

Building
========

Clone, generate environment for your favorite build system (we use CMake as abstraction layer), then compile. For example,

    % git clone https://github.com/mikedld/bt-migrate
    % cd bt-migrate
    % git submodule update --init --force
    % mkdir _build
    % cd _build
    % export CXX=g++
    % cmake ..
    % cmake --build .

Running
=======

There are a number of command-line arguments you could use:
  * `--source <NAME>` — BitTorrent client name you're migrating from (see below)
  * `--source-dir <PATH>` — path to source BitTorrent client data directory
  * `--target <NAME>` — BitTorrent client name you're migrating to (see below)
  * `--target-dir <PATH>` — path to target BitTorrent client data directory

Currently supported clients include (names are case-insensitive):
  * "Deluge" (only export)
  * "rTorrent" (only export)
  * "Transmission" (only import)
  * "TransmissionMac" (only import)
  * "uTorrent" (only export)
  * "uTorrentWeb" (only export)

Whether only `--source`, only `--source-dir`, or both (same goes for target arguments) are required depends on program ability to guess needed information. If client name allows (by checking various places) to find data directory, then the latter is optional. If path to data directory allows (by analyzing its content) to guess corresponding client name, then the latter is optional. Sometimes it's not possible to guess anything, or name/path guessed don't suit you, so both arguments are required.

Some other possible arguments include:
  * `--no-backup` — do not backup (but simply overwrite) any existing files
  * `--dry-run` — do not write anything to disk (useful to check if migration is possible at all)

Example use:

    % ./BtMigrate --source deluge --target-dir ~/.config/transmission --dry-run
    % ./BtMigrate --source rtorrent --source-dir ~/.session --target transmission --target-dir ~/.config/transmission-daemon --dry-run

For a complete set of arguments, execute:

    % ./BtMigrate --help
